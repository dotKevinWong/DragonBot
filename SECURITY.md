## 🏚️ Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report security vulnerabilities by submitting a comment in the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/invite/KCkj4CeMtD) under the [`#security-reports`](https://discord.com/channels/1095523216098861188/1099433676808405084) channel. Please include the following information in your security vulnerability report:
- The vulnerability you found
- How you found the vulnerability or steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- How you think the vulnerability can be fixed (*if you know*)

Please note that once you submit a security report, the message will be automatically hidden in the server. We will update the community about the security vulnerability once we have a fix.
