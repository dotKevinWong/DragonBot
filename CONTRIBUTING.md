## ü§ì Contributing

We welcome all contributions, including bug reports, feature requests, design suggestions and pull requests. Here are some guidelines to follow when contributing to DragonBot.

## üñ•Ô∏è Getting Started
You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine. You will also need to have setup a [Discord Developer Application](https://discord.com/developers/applications). 

Optionally, you can setup a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project and a [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) account if you want to test the bot's features that require a database or email delivery.

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository to your machine
3. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`

You need to setup environment variables using a [`.env`](.env.example) file in the root directory of the project. The [`.env`](.env.example) file should contain the following variables:
```env
DISCORD_API_TOKEN=
BOT_CLIENT_ID=
EMAIL_API_KEY=
```
You can copy the example [`.env`](.env.example) file and fill in the variables.

Once you have setup the environment variables, you can start the bot. 

4. Run the bot by running `node index.js`
