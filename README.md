* 👨‍⚖️ Ban Syncing
* 📚 Course Information
* 😎 User Profiles
* 📊 Server Statistics
* 🧰 Moderation Tools

## 😎 Getting Started
You don't have to host the bot yourself. If you're interested in using DragonBot and are part of the Drexel University community, you can join the [DragonBot Discord Server](https://discord.gg/invite/KCkj4CeMtD) and use the bot there.

## 🤓 Technology
DragonBot is built using [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/), a JavaScript library for interacting with the Discord API. The bot uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for its database. The bot is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and uses [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) for email delivery.
